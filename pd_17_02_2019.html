				<h3><i class="fas fa-bible"></i> FROM THE PASTOR'S DESK:</h3>
        <h6><u>February 2nd, 2019</u></h6>
				<h4><b><u>Jesus is standing at the door and knocking, will you open for him?</u></b></h4>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me.
            <footer>Revelation 3:20 NKJV</footer>
					</blockquote>
        </p>
					<p id="firstline">I still remember vividly one night some forty six years ago as a young man in high school. It was a Sunday evening and over six hundred students were gathered in the school hall listening to a young University of Nairobi masters student preaching. As he talked about Christ as his Lord and Saviour, I felt some conviction that I also needed to open my heart to allow Christ in so that he could also become my Saviour.</P>
          <P>It was such a struggle for me to surrender and swallow my pride and overcome fear about what other students would think if I walked forward to be prayed for. Finally, I gathered courage and went forward. The young preacher led me through a prayer of confession and I received Christ as Lord and Saviour of my life. It was such a relief and joy for me. I had never felt such joy and peace in my heart. That was the beginning of my long walk with the Lord up to this day.</P>
          <p>What Revelation 3:20 says has been proved true by many through centuries who dared to surrender and open their hearts to Christ to come in. Jesus said that he stands at the door and knocks. If anyone opens the door to allow him in, he comes in and dines with him and he with him. Dining talks of joyful sharing of a sumptuous meal together in an atmosphere of joy, happiness and peace. This meal is prepared at Christ's own expense. He is the source of peace and joy; he meets all our spiritual, social and material needs.</p>
          <p>You might be one who over the years have heard of the saving grace of God. Often, the word of God may have been preached and you felt convicted and thought of accepting Christ to be Lord and Saviour of your life. But another voice told you, No, don't do that today; take time and think about it. May, be the voice said: No, you are too young; wait until you are slightly older. Another voice may have sent shivers down your spine saying: What about if you get saved then backslide, what will people say?</p>
          <p> All these were voices of Satan and his agents. Whenever you feel a conviction quickly open the door and let Christ come into your heart; that is the day of your salvation. <em>Will you open the door of your heart today and allow Christ to come in and dine with you?</em> The choice is yours.</p>
