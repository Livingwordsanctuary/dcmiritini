				<h3><i class="fas fa-bible"></i> FROM THE PASTOR'S DESK:</h3>
        <h6><u>November 10th, 2019</u></h6>
				<h4><b><u>God cannot lie</u></b></h4>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?
            <footer>-Numbers 23:19 NKJV</footer>
					</blockquote></p>
					<p id="firstline">We live in a world and at a time when lying is often accepted as normal. People will make promises while clearly knowing that they will not fulfill them. Even among believers the so-called white lies are quite common. "Yes I will be there," someone will tell another, while knowing that they will not be there Because lying and speaking half truth is so common among people, it is possible to unconsciously think that even what God has said will not happen. Infact, many times, we pray without expecting an answer from God even when God has promised in his word to answer our prayers.</p> 
          <p>We are so used to hearing human promises which are never kept, that we unintentionally associate God with similar kind of behavior. We will hear somebody say, "I am praying about it but I am not sure God will answer me." For this reason, Balaam asked Balak, "Has the Lord said something that he will not do? Has he spoken something that He will not make good?"The answer is, No. Whatever God has promised He will cause it to come to pass.</p> 
          <p>This reminds me of God's promise to us as a church. In a few weeks time, Living Word Sanctuary will be eleven years old. The doors to this church were opened on December 21, 2008 at Miritini World Bank Primary School. As I look back and see what God has done for us, I see nothing but the faithfulness of our God. From handful of people at a classroom some eleven years ago, we have grown to where we are today because of God's faithfulness.</p> 
          <p>Personally as the Pastor of this church, God has spoken to me many times about the direction and destiny to which he is leading us. Every one of these promises is being fulfilled as the days go by.</p>
          <p>As 2019 comes to a close, and we usher in 2020,let us look up to the faithfulness of God to us as a church, as individuals and as families and be assured that, what he has promised will surely come to pass. We can always count on his unfailing promises.</p>
