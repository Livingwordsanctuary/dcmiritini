        <h6><u>April 23rd, 2017</u></h6>
				<h4><b><u>Have you been raised with Christ?</u></b></h4>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
            <footer>-Colossians 3:1 NASB</footer>
					</blockquote></p>
					<p id="firstline">We have just celebrated Easter. By the way why is the period of death and resurrection of Christ called Easter? Somebody had asked this question in the social media and it may be a good research question. Easter is the time Christians all over the world remember the suffering, crucifixion and resurrection of our Saviour 
          Jesus Christ. Like in many other Christian festival seasons, people are taken up by the excitement that comes with the seasons and forget the significance.</p> 
          <p>There are celebrations which include eating, drinking and touring. We see the same kind of activities during the Christmas season. But for you and me who believe in the salvation which Christ brought to us, what does Easter mean?
          aul in writing to the Christians of Colossae, told ‘ them: “If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking those things that are above where Christ is seated on the right hand of God “The question is, “Have you been raised up with Christ? “If your answer is yes, then Easter is a very significant period for you. Christ was crucified, died was buried and rose up from the dead so that you too may die to sin and live a new life in Christ. So, Paul is saying that if you claim to be alive in Christ, then you must keep seeking or pursuing ' those things that are heavenly, not earthly things. Many ' have celebrated Easter but that is all. They travelled, had a good time with their families up country, ate sumptuous meals and now things are back to normal until Christmas when they will again celebrate.</p> 
          <p>Saint Paul tells us not to seek once or occasionally but ‘ always, things that are above. He is telling us to live true Christian lives which bring glory to God from January to December. This does not come easily; we have to spend time in prayer and study of the scriptures to know the will of God and the things that are above.</p>
          <p>May the season of Easter act to remind us that even though we are in this world, we are not of this world. May we keep seeking those things which are above where Christ is seated on the right hand of God.</p>
