				<h4><b><u>Praying without ceasing for those in the mission field.</u></b></h4>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers <footer>Romans 1:9 KJV</footer>
					</blockquote></p>
					<p id="firstline">Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 1:17). <em>What does it mean to pray without ceasing?</em> It certainly does not mean that you are always in prayer or on your knees. It means that you are praying regularly and oftenly. You don't stop or give up or stay for long periods of time without praying.</p> 
          <p>I thank God for the missions week we have been having since Monday. Thank you all who fasted and prayed individually and attended the joint prayers we were having every day up to Friday. We had a lot to bring before God as we prayed for missions and missionaries. God will reward all of you who sacrificed so much. But after praying for the last one week, what next? Are we to wait until the next missions week to pray againfor missions and missionaries? Paul was a great intercessor. In several of his epistles, he speaks of constantly praying for both the believers he had reached with the gospel and his traveling companions like Apollos, Timothy and others.</p> 
          <p>In Romans 1:7 which we have quoted above, he says that God is his witness of how often and unceasingly he prayed for the Roman brethren. How many of us can say the same? How many can cite God as witness of how unceasingly they pray for missionaries and missions? No wonder he repeats the same in a short instruction to the Thessalonians: "Pray without ceasing."</p> 
          <p> Living Word Sanctuary has chosen to be a missionaries supporting and sending church. It behooves us to support missionaries in every way: materially, financially, and spiritually and so on. Above all, we should pray for missions and missionaries without ceasing. It should not happen only during the missions week. Nor should it happen only when we gather together at church. We should constantly pray individually and as a corporate local body of Christ.
          May the Lord bless you as you continue to pray for
          missions and missionaries without ceasing.</p>
