				<h3><i class="fas fa-bible"></i> FROM THE PASTOR'S DESK:</h3>
        <h6><u>November 17th, 2019</u></h6>
				<h4><b><u>Dead yet Alive</u></b></h4>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Jesus Christ.
            <footer>Romans 6:10, 11 ESV</footer>
					</blockquote></p>
					<p id="firstline">In chapter six of Romans, Paul begins by asking a question: <em>"Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?"</em> Some of the believers in Rome had misunderstood the grace of God. They thought or preached that the more they sinned, the more grace was available. They did not understand the full purpose for Christ's death and resurrection and how it related to their new lives in Christ. Paul therefore sought to clarify what Christ's death and resurrection signified and its relationship to their faith in him. He said that by dying on the cross, Christ died to sin; by rising from the dead, he began to live a new life in God.</p> 
          <p>In the same way, when we put our faith in Christ and trust in his shed blood for our cleansing and forgiveness, we die to sin. We then begin to live new lives in Christ. This is what water baptism signifies.
          It is very wrong for people to claim to be born again but continue to live in sin as they did before. This is trampling the blood of Christ under our feet-treating it as of no value. This is the tragedy in the church of Christ today. People are claiming to be saved and even serving in all kinds of ways in the church but living in sin, particularly sexual sin. Their consciences die and they feel no guilt about their double lives in the church.</p> 
          <p>Judgment day is coming and if you are like this, you will not escape it. Paul put it very succinctly in II Corinthians 5:17:<em> "If anyone is in Christ he is a new creation; old things have passed away, behold everything has become new"</em>. How can you be in the church claiming to be saved and yet living in sin?</p>
          <p>Repent immediately or otherwise God will expose you and judge you harshly. In Living word sanctuary we baptize people who have given their lives to Christ. In doing this, we shall be demonstrating publicly what has happened in their lives after they gave their lives to Christ-they died to sin and have been raised to righteousness. Henceforth they will walk in newness of life.</p>
          <p>God bless you</p>
